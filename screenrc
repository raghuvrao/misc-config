# Set terminfo capabilities for hardstatus for the xterm term-type.  Set the
# capabilities in such a way that when this capability is used, it updates the
# window title and icon name (by using the corresponding control sequence, in
# this case, the OSC sequence OSC 0 ; TEXT BEL).

# 'alwayslastline' will tell screen not to use the terminal's hardstatus line,
# and instead use a display line for hardstatus (typically, the last line in
# the display area).  Some versions of GNU Screen will use the terminal's
# hardstatus capability even when the alwayslastline option is set.  So, if
# you have set hardstatus to alwayslastline, and you are wondering why your
# terminal's titlebar is not getting updated, then do not set hardstatus to
# alwayslastline.
